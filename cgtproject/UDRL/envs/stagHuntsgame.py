    Stag Hunt Game:
      - Two players, each with two actions.
        Action 0: Stag
        Action 1: Hare
      - Typical payoffs:
          * Both choose Stag: Each receives a intermediate payoff (e.g., 2).
          * Both choose Hare: Each receives an low payoff (e.g., 1).
          * One chooses Stag while the other chooses Hare: The Stag hunter gets nothing (0) and the Hare hunter gets a moderate payoff (e.g., 3).
      - The state for each player is a one-hot encoding (of length 2) of the opponentâ€™s last action.
